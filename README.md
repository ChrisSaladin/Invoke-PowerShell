# Invoke-PowerShell
A fun repository where I can run invoke - commands with powershell.
To run any of the scripts I have in here, simply run the command at the top of any of the scripts in powershell, pwsh, cmd, or even run.exe - it all works. 
Please note, some of these scripts require powershell7 to be installed. If they do, it will say so at the top of the file.
