# Invoke-PowerShell
A fun repository where I can run invoke - commands with powershell.
To run any of the scripts I have in here, simply use the following command and place the link to the raw content (link included in the header of each invoke file) in the quotes. 
Please note, some scripts require to be run in powershell7

'Invoke-expression (invoke-webrequest "" -usebasicparsing).content'
